# TDD test (test driven development)
Some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behavior of your code 
Follow AAA method in the structure for the test:
Arrange(input), Act (exercise the behavior: execute the code), Assert (check the output result)
The cycle for test is 
-	Write a unite test and make it fail
-	Write the feature and make the test pass
-	Refactor the code 

# What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do?
-	A "script" is a Python file that’s intended to be run directly
-	A "module" is a file containing Python definitions and statements and it imported to other file 
-	If we want not to execute the code other than function or statement; when we import the file, we use the if 
-	The if helps us not to run the code after it outside of its original file
# Recursion 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. 
Every recursive function should have a base condition that will stop the loop of calling the function and start to solve each step until the function come up with the final result
